# Codewars Katas - Level Up Plan


## Why this?
I wanted to sort Codewars katas (code problems) for people learning JavaScript so they can work their way up through a list sorted by my perceived difficulty level. The difficulty level of Codewars katas can vary too much for students. Especially since new students will have a hard time knowing if a problem is difficult or easy.
(This list might work partially for other languages like C++/Ruby/Python/etc.)

# Let's do this
To level up your skills, do these in order. There's references in each section for you to view. If that's not enough, please Google concepts. And avoid Googling the specific problem/solution.

Important! When you're done with a kata, try to explain your answer out-loud. Explain each line one-by-one.

# Rinse and repeat
When you're done with the list, or feel like you have hit a wall, go back. Go to the beginning and re-do all the problems. Your goal will be to work on understanding the problems without having to use your references.
